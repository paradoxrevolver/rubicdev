  <p>my name is rubic, paradoxrevolver, or you can call me adam.</p>
  
  <p>this website is rubic.dev, home to all the projects and parts i've worked on over the years.</p>
  
  <p>i'm an artist, programmer, and game designer that enjoys creating useful tools and clever games. i'm currently a student at San Jose State University graduating in fall of 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a minor in Mathematics.</p>
  
  <p>my goal is to find a place in game development where i can write code, draw art, and design experiences that inspire others.</p>

<div id="art" class="island">
  <h1 class="title"><a href="#art">art</a></h1>

  <p>i spent most of 2014 to 2017 improving my drawing. although my focus has since shifted towards programming, i still often return to drawing or modeling just to remember how to do it.</p>

  <div id="art-gallery">
    {% assign frames = site.data.home.art.frames %}
    {% for frame in frames %}
    <div class="frame border">
      <img class="border-x" src="{{frame.img}}">
      <div class="toolbar">
        <a class="tool" href="{{frame.img}}" target="_blank"><i class="far fa-file-image"></i></a>
      </div>

<div id="code" class="island">
  <h1 class="title"><a href="#code">code</a></h1>

  <p>although the first thing i ever programmed in Python dates all the way back to 2012, i only began taking it seriously starting in early 2016. this section is for coding projects where the emphasis was on the problem i was trying to solve with programming or the project otherwise wasn't dependent on other disciplines.</p>

  <div id="code-gallery">
    {% assign frames = site.data.home.code.frames %}
    {% for frame in frames %}

      <a href="{{frame.url}}"><img src="{{frame.img}}"></a>

    {% endfor %}

<div id="sound" class="island">
  <h1 class="title"><a href="#sound">sound</a></h1>

  <p>music has had a huge influence on me for as long as i can remember, but an interest in programming and art have greatly reduced the amount of time i have ever had to focus on it. i used to make short chiptune tracks in tracker software in 2013.</p>

<div id="design" class="island">
  <h1 class="title"><a href="#design">design</a></h1>

  <p>this section is for any of my more ambitious projects that a single picture wouldn't do justice. games that i create will most certainly be here. these projects are often ones i produced with a team and are closed-source because we plan to formally release it.</p>

  <div id="design-gallery">

  <p>here are other places you can find my work. i'm pretty terrible about posting consistently to social media but i'd like to get a better hang of it.</p>
