  <p>my name is rubic, paradoxrevolver, or you can call me adam.</p>
  
  <p>this website is rubic.dev, home to all the projects and parts i've worked on over the years.</p>
  
  <p>i'm an artist, programmer, and game designer that enjoys creating useful tools and clever games. i'm currently a student at San Jose State University graduating in fall 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a minor in Mathematics.</p>
  
  <p>my goal is to find a place in game development where i can write code, draw art, and design experiences that inspire others.</p>

<div id="art" class="island">
  <h1 class="title"><a href="#art">art</a></h1>

  <p>i started drawing in 2014. while more of my focus over the years have been directed towards programming, i still occasionally return to drawing or modeling just to remember how to use a pen.</p>

  <p>the main tools i use for art includes Paint Tool SAI, Paint.NET, Aseprite, Illustrator, and Blender.</p>

  <div id="art-gallery">
    {% assign image_list = site.static_files | where: "art", true %}
    {% for image in image_list %}

        <a class="tool" href="{{image.path}}" target="_blank"><i class="far fa-file-image"></i></a>

<div id="code" class="island">
  <h1 class="title"><a href="#code">code</a></h1>

  <p>this section is for coding projects where the emphasis was on the problem i was trying to solve with programming or the project otherwise wasn't dependent on other artistic disciplines.</p>

  <p>over the years i've programmed in a lot of different languages using a lot of different tools. today i'm strongly familiar with Java, C#, and JavaScript and comfortable in Python and C++.</p>

  <p>i've been using Visual Studio for C++ and have also used it for C#. i've also worked with several of the JetBrains development environments including PyCharm and Rider. i've used Visual Studio Code, Brackets, and Atom for web development.</p>

<div id="design" class="island">
  <h1 class="title"><a href="#design">design</a></h1>

  <p>this section is for any of my more ambitious projects that a single picture wouldn't do justice. games that i create will most certainly be here. these projects are often ones i produced with a team and are closed-source because we plan to formally release it.</p>

  <p>here are other places you can find my work. i'm pretty terrible about posting consistently to social media but i'd like to get a better hang of it.</p>
