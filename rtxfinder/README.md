A page that displays exclusively GeForce RTX 3060 Ti video cards as they become available from various sellers online.

I discovered that the 3060 Ti is currently the most cost effective card among high-end consumer GPUs, so I just slapped together this page in a day to make it easier to hunt for the best deal.

Bad prices are anything above $570 USD.

Good prices are $530 - $570 USD.

Great prices are $500 - $530 USD.

Excellent prices are $500 USD or lower.

Thank you to [Falcodrin](https://www.twitch.tv/falcodrin) for running a continuous stream of data related to GPU cards and other tech goodies.
